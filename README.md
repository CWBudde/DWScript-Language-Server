# DWScript-Language-Server
The DWScript-Language-Server uses the Language Server protocol to provide support for DWScript in editors and other tools.
While at the moment it is pretty limited, it should suppors editor features such as go-to-definition, hover, and find-references for DWScript projects.

## Editors
At the moment only the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor is supported directly. However others should also be able to work with the language server
