# DWScript-Language-Server Clients
At the moment only the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor is supported as client. Within VSCode you can easily download the DWScript language server extension.

The internal client is currently only used in the unit test. However, it could easily get extended to be used in an independent project (e.g. an editor written in Delphi) in the future.
